            <p>WordPress is a free and open source content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL. It is the most widely used CMS software in the world, and as of June 2021, it powers more than 40% of the top 10 million websites and has an estimated 64% market share of all websites built using a CMS.</p>
            <p>WordPress started as a simple blogging system in 2003, but it has evolved into a full CMS with thousands of plugins, widgets, and themes. It is licensed under the General Public License (GPLv2 or later).</p>
            <p>To learn more about WordPress, please refer to the list of standard WordPress features.</p>

            <p>Gutenberg is a codename for a whole new paradigm in WordPress site building and publishing, that aims to revolutionize the entire publishing experience as much as Gutenberg did the printed word. The project is right now in the second phase of a four-phase process that will touch every piece of WordPress &mdash; Editing, Customization (which includes Full Site Editing, Block Patterns, Block Directory and Block based themes), Collaboration, and Multilingual &mdash; and is focused on a new editing experience, the block editor (which is the topic of the current documentation).</p>
            <figure><img src="assets/images/quick-view-of-the-block-editor.png" alt="Quick view of the block editor">
              <figcaption><span>1.</span> Block Inserter <span>2.</span> Block editor content area <span>3.</span> Settings Sidebar</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Using a system of Blocks to compose and format content, the new block-based editor is designed to create rich, flexible layouts for websites and digital products. Content is created in the unit of blocks instead of freeform text with inserted media, embeds and Shortcodes (there&rsquo;s a Shortcode block though).</p>
            <p>Blocks treat Paragraphs, Headings, Media, and Embeds all as components that, when strung together, make up the content stored in the WordPress database, replacing the traditional concept of freeform text with embedded media and shortcodes. The new editor is designed with progressive enhancement, meaning that it is back-compatible with all legacy content, and it also offers a process to try to convert and split a Classic block into equivalent blocks using client-side parsing. Finally, the blocks offer enhanced editing and format controls.</p>
            <p>The Editor offers rich new value to users with visual, drag-and-drop creation tools and powerful developer enhancements with modern vendor packages, reusable components, rich APIs and hooks to modify and extend the editor through Custom Blocks, Custom Block Styles and Plugins.</p>
            <p>Learn to use the block editor to create media-rich posts and pages.</p>

          <article aria-label="Responsive Images">
            <h2>Responsive Images</h2>
            <p>Since WordPress 4.4, native responsive images is supported by including srcset and sizes attributes to the image markup it generates. For background on this feature, read the merge proposal.</p>
            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>By including the available sizes of an image into a <code class="inline-code">srcset</code> attribute, it allows the software to automatically use and display the right image based on a device&rsquo;s screen size. If you attach a full size 1500 x 706 image to a post in WordPress, mobile devices will see the large or medium-sized image instead&mdash;potentially saving bandwidth and speeding up page load times in the process.</p>
            <p>Note that for compatibility with existing markup, neither <code class="inline-code">srcset</code> nor sizes are added or modified if they already exist in content HTML. Responsive images don&rsquo;t have any settings to configure as the magic happens behind the scenes.</p>
            <h3>Browser Side</h3>
            <p>To help browsers select the best image from the source set list, WordPress also include a default sizes attribute that is equivalent to <code class="inline-code">(max-width: {{image-width}}px) 100vw, {{image-width}}px</code>. While this default will work out of the box for a majority of sites, themes should customize the default sizes attribute as needed using the <code class="inline-code">wp_calculate_image_sizes</code> filter.</p>
            <p>A normal browser request goes to server, server sends back response. This response includes links to other resources &ndash; fonts, css, JS, and images. The browser notices these resources, and sends additional requests to the server and fetches those resources.</p>
            <h3>Customizing responsive image markup</h3>
            <p>To modify the default srcset and sizes attributes, you should use the <code class="inline-code">wp_calculate_image_srcset</code> and <code class="inline-code">wp_calculate_image_sizes</code> filters, respectively.</p>
            <p>Overriding the srcset or sizes attributes for images not embedded in post content (e.g. post thumbnails, galleries, etc.), can be accomplished using the <code class="inline-code">wp_get_attachment_image_attributes</code> filter, similar to how other image attributes are modified.</p>
            <p>Additionally, you can create your own custom markup patterns by using <code class="inline-code">wp_get_attachment_image_srcset()</code> directly in your templates. Here is an example of how you could use this function to build an <code class="inline-code">&lt;img&gt;</code> element with a custom sizes attribute:</p><code class="block-code">
              &lt;?php
              $img_src = wp_get_attachment_image_url( $attachment_id, &apos;medium&apos; );
              $img_srcset = wp_get_attachment_image_srcset( $attachment_id, &apos;medium&apos; );
              ?&gt;
              &lt;img src=&quot;&lt;?php echo esc_url( $img_src ); ?&gt;&quot; srcset=&quot;&lt;?php echo esc_attr( $img_srcset ); ?&gt;&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 50em) 87vw, 680px&quot; alt=&quot;Foo Bar&quot;&gt;</code>

          <h2>Rest API</h2>
          <article>
            <p>The WordPress REST API provides an interface for applications to interact with your WordPress site by sending and receiving data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. It is the foundation of the WordPress Block Editor, and can likewise enable your theme, plugin or custom application to present new, powerful interfaces for managing and publishing your site content.</p>
            <p>Using the WordPress REST API you can create a plugin to provide an entirely new admin experiences for WordPress, build a brand new interactive front-end experience, or bring your WordPress content into completely separate applications.</p>
            <p>The REST API is a developer-oriented feature of WordPress. It provides data access to the content of your site, and implements the same authentication restrictions &mdash; content that is public on your site is generally publicly accessible via the REST API, while private content, password-protected content, internal users, custom post types, and metadata is only available with authentication or if you specifically set it to be so. If you are not a developer, the most important thing to understand about the API is that it enables the block editor and modern plugin interfaces without compromising the security or privacy of your site.</p>
            <h3>What is a Rest API?</h3>
            <p>An API is an Application Programming Interface. REST, standing for &ldquo;REpresentational State Transfer,&rdquo; is a set of concepts for modeling and accessing your application&rsquo;s data as interrelated objects and collections. The WordPress REST API provides REST endpoints (URLs) representing the posts, pages, taxonomies, and other built-in WordPress data types. Your application can send and receive JSON data to these endpoints to query, modify and create content on your site. JSON is an open standard data format that is lightweight and human-readable, and looks like Objects do in JavaScript. When you request content from or send content to the API, the response will also be returned in JSON. Because JSON is widely supported in many programming languages, developers can build WordPress applications in client-side JavaScript (like the block editor), as mobile apps, or as desktop or command line tools.</p>
            <p class="info-box">The REST API is just one of many APIs provided by WordPress. You can find the documentation on these additional APIs here.</p>
